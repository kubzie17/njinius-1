## NJinius

Welcome to NJinius Engineering Club where iron sharpens iron...

NJinius was created to help people of all ability levels develop their understanding of programming and business. We are creating a community of like-minded individuals who seek to expand and develop a 360 understanding of their respective industry. We hold workshops, tutorials and discussions in many different subject areas for this purpose, offering a relaxed environment to learn and develop new skills.  

NJinius is not limited to work and industry; this is a space designed to nurture creativity, personal development, friendships and collaborations. Our blog pages offer every user an opportunity to express their interests and ideas. We also encourage you to share and discuss your work freely. The community is welcome to challenge each otherâ€™s ideas and perspectives. However, please treat everyone with respect, and in all your interactions, we urge you to remember that this is a platform to help each other grow, collaborate and inspire.  

So please join us, innovate, have fun and do something NJinius!
